      Access to the digital platform based on a Discord server is provided
      through a monthly membership, which customers can purchase through website
      and dashboard, by connecting their Discord account to the dashboard.
      <br />
      <br />
      After making payment, the customer is automatically added to our Discord
      server as a member through the dashboard, and gains direct access to the
      platform with Discord role. Membership has auto-renewal feature via member
      dashboard, but members can cancel auto-renewal through dashboard at any
      moment.
